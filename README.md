# Busayo's Data Portfolio (SQL & Tableau)

Hello! 
Thanks for stopping by! As a data driven professional, I understand the importance of insights within an organization.
Having knowledge of data analysis and visualization has provided me with a track record of improving insights and data driven decision making within my organization.
I'm skilled at querying data using SQL, (MySQL) and visually providing insights using Tableau, Qlik, Microsoft Excel, and more. 
This repository contains an example of SQL queries i've written for personal projects. It also includes data visualization I developed using Tableau. 
Feel free to explore my Gitbub and [reach out](busayo.ha@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

## Highlighted Projects

* Covid Data Analysis - [SQL](https://github.com/busayoadepoju/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Covid%20Portfolio%20Project.sql): In this project, I used the 2020 covid dataset provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). I created a local database on my personal device, and using MySQL Workbench editor, I created the tables required for the queries. I analyzed the percentage of deaths against total cases, total number of cases across multiple regions, and how vaccination affected new cases.
  
* Udemy Subscriber Analysis - [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/UdemySampledata-Practice/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link): This project analyzes a Udemy dataset with the objective of providing insights to the CFO of Udemy for improved decision making.  Udemy is an online learning platform that covers a range of topics at various price points across 3 tiers of expertise. The dashboard visually provides the following information for the CFO:
  - The average number of subscribers per subject
  - An overview of content duration by price
  - The average course price across each level of expertise.
