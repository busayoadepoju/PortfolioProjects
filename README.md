Thanks for stopping by! As a data driven professional, I understand the importance of insights within an organization.
aving knowledge of data analysis and visualization has provided me with a track record of improving insights and data driven decision making within my organization.
I'm skilled at querying data using SQL, (MySQL) and visually providing insights using Tableau, Qlik, Microsoft Excel, and more. 
This repository contains an example of SQL queries i've written for personal projects. It also includes data visualization I developed using Tableau.
